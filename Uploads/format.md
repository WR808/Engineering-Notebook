## Format for Engineering Notebook Entries

**Filename:** mm/dd/yy.md
> Example: 10/06/18.md

**Title:** mm/dd/yyyy
> Example: 10/06/2018
<br>
<br>
**Content:** You can copy and paste the content from a previous entry such as [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WR808/Engineering-Notebook/master/Notebook/10.6.18.md) one) and simply change the information to fit the day's entry.
<br>
<br>
**Why use Markdown?:** Markdown allows us to store all of our notebook entries in a place where every member of the team can access them and make changes, if necessary. Also, it's what Mr. Sullivan told us to use. Additionally, Markdown plays really nicely with Google Docs and Microsoft Word, so it'll be easy for us to migrate our notebook into one of these softwares when the time comes for printing.
<br>
<br>
**Text formatting:** Here are some basic text formatting methods.
<br>
> New line:
  ```<br>```
<br>
> Bold: 
  ```**text**```
<br>
> Italics: ```_text_```
<br>
<br>
**Embedding an image:** Drag your image into the box on [this](https://github.com/WR808/Engineering-Notebook/upload/master/Uploads) page. Once it's uploaded, find the file you uploaded [here](https://github.com/WR808/Engineering-Notebook/tree/master/Uploads), then click on it. You should see a preview of the file. On that preview, right click and select ```Open Image in New Tab```. The URL of the page that opens should begin with ```raw.githubusercontent.com```. Copy the **full** address to your clipboard.
<br>
<br>
Then, go to the file that you want to insert the image into. Paste the following code where you wish to have the image in your entry. ```<img src="url">``` Replace ```url``` with the URL you copied. 
<br>
<br>
**Managing Dimensions: **If the image appears too large or small, you can modify the dimensions by using this code instead. ```<img src="url" width="x%" height="y%">``` Again, replace URL with the URL that you copied. Replace ```x``` and ```y``` with percentages relative to the original image's dimensions.<br>
<br>

> End Result Example:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WR808/Engineering-Notebook/master/Uploads/example.png" width="50%" height="50%">

**Committing Changes:** Once you're done, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Put a message detailing the changes you made into the smaller box, and elaborate in the larger box if necessary. Click the green button that says ```Commit Changes``` to save your work.
