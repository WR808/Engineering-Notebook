I worked with Brennen on the code and uploading the code on to the phone.I first wired the motors the came over to the computer and Brennen had started on the coding but we had trouble finding the file but Brennen eventually found the file on the Github and put it on android studios where we adjusted the code from last year to fit our current year’s robot. Mainly all we had to do was change all the names of the drive system. Once we had made the appropriate changes to the program, we tried to pull the program over to the phone. Even though we kind of knew how to transfer the program we couldn’t because it wouldn’t give us a specific notification on the computer so we tried again and again and again but we had no success at the end Brennen got one of the requirements but we didn’t transfer the program yet. We got stuff done but we still have a lot to do before November.
