**DESIGN**

Brennan and I worked on the design of our arm to lift to and drop our robot from the platform. We looked up many ways to do this. First we looked at a cascading lift and decided that the continuous lift with a hook would be better. We designed it to have two anchor pieces and have the middle piece be lifted up by using a chain and a motor with a gear, this would be attached to the middle bar going from front to back on the chassis. After designing the arm, we had a bit of a break to listen to music and eat some chips. Then we got to figuring out how we will set up the gear and the motor on the metal piece to hold it up. We decided to use and axel through them both. We still need to figure out the side supports. We were also not able to start on the actual building.

**PROGRAMMING**

I worked on setting up the development environment (Android Studio) on my laptop. We followed the instructions listed on the FTC project’s GitHub page to download and setup the FTC development environment in Android Studio. The documentation instructed us to move to our Robotics directory (/Users/roen/Desktop/Files/Robotics/) and run the command ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git``` in the Terminal. This command succeeded and a directory called ```ftc_app``` appeared in the Robotics folder.

We made a few small changes to the program, mostly fixing compiler errors and experimenting with Gradle. Once we got to a working version, I tried to push to GitHub but it always said ```! [remote rejected] lcs -> master (shallow update not allowed)```. We researched the issue, and found a StackOverflow question about it. The problem was that we were trying to push what was once a repository with a lot of commits/history into a new repository with no history. This was a security measure to ensure that you do not accidentally overwrite commit history and erase crucial parts of your project. This was solved by re-cloning our repository without the depth flag.

Lastly, I set up one of our team’s Moto G4 Play phones. I followed a tutorial on YouTube that detailed the guidelines of phone setup for use with FTC and taught you how to set up the phone, including setting the Wi-Fi group name to something like ```TeamID-F-RC```. Next meeting, I would like to set up the other phone and link them. I’m not sure if it’s easy, but I’d also like to start writing some code and experiment with servo motors. Some time in the next week, I’ll upload all of our sketches and other related documents that are on the team Facebook page to the GitHub organization’s Engineering Notebook repository, so everyone can access and modify the files easily.
