**PROGRAMMING**

Me, Brennen and Ewan worked on the programing, but Brennen did most of the work because there was only one computer with android studios. Me and Ewan set up Github accounts. We setup the phones finally but the remotes weren’t working however we discovered that the remotes can only work together. We got some things done today but we only have 2 days left.

**BUILD**

Today I worked with Ainsley and Tyler to finish up the linear slide and build a hook. Ainsley worked on the hook and Tyler and I worked on freeing up the friction on the slide. We disassembled it and loosened it up a bit. Once we got it moving smoothly, we reattached it and began experimenting with extending and retracting. With a rather painful snap on Tylers part, we discovered that the surgical tube won’t stretch far enough, and breaks under pressure. We decided then to switch to two wires running in opposite directions. After a bit of experimentation, we got the wire hooked up and are now just waiting for the code to be written to test it.
